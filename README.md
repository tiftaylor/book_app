# Search Google Books App | Lab 11 - 14 | Code Fellows 301

**Author**: Tif Taylor  
**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Heroku URL**: [https://tiftaylor-booklist.herokuapp.com/](https://tiftaylor-booklist.herokuapp.com/)


## Overview
For Code Fellows 301 Week 3, we are creating a mobile first, full-stack application that searches Google's books API. It includes the ability to search the Google Books API, add books to a database, and render the books from a PostgreSQL database to the client. It will also have the ability to update details of a book or remove it from a collection.

## Getting Started
- Create your own GitHub Repo and build out the base files seen in this repo such as the .env, .gitignore, etc.
- Create the server
- Deploy the site somewhere, like Heroku
- Use the Google Books API: [Getting Started](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started)
