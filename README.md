# Search Google Books App | Lab 11 - 14 | Code Fellows 301

**Author**: Tif Taylor  
**Version**: 3.1.0  
**Heroku URL**: [https://tiftaylor-booklist.herokuapp.com/](https://tiftaylor-booklist.herokuapp.com/)


## Overview
For Code Fellows 301 Week 3, we are creating a mobile first, full-stack application that searches Google's books API. It includes the ability to search the Google Books API, add books to a database, and render the books from a PostgreSQL database to the client. It will also have the ability to update details of a book or remove it from a collection.


## Getting Started
- Create your own GitHub Repo and build out the base files seen in this repo such as the .env, .gitignore, etc.
- Create the server
- Deploy the site somewhere, like Heroku
- Use the Google Books API: [Getting Started](https://developers.google.com/books/docs/v1/getting_started)


## Architecture
HTML > CSS > JavaScript > Express > Node.js > Superagent pkg > EJS pkg > Google Books API


**schema.sql** | Table name: books
  - id - serial primary key
  - author - author name
  - title - title of the book
  - isbn - the ISBN number associated with the title
  - image_url - an image of the book cover
  - description - a summary of what the book is about
